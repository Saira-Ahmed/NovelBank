📚 Novel Bank (MASM x86)

🧾 Project Description

The Novel Bank Management System is a console-based application developed using MASM x86 (32-bit Assembly Language) with the Irvine32 library.
This project simulates a basic novel lending system where users can add novels, view available novels, borrow novels, and return them.

It is designed as a lab final / academic project to demonstrate fundamental assembly language programming concepts.

🎯 Objectives

Learn programming using MASM x86 assembly language

Implement data storage using arrays

Use loops and conditional jumps

Build a menu-driven console application

Apply Irvine32 library procedures for input and output

⚙️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: MASM x86 (32-bit Assembly)

Library: Irvine32.inc

Platform: Windows (Console Application)

Assembler: MASM

IDE: Visual Studio (with Irvine32 setup)

📌 Features

Add new novels (ID, Name, Author, Quantity)

Display all stored novels

Borrow a novel by ID

Return a borrowed novel

Simple menu-driven interface

🧠 Concepts Used

Procedures

One-dimensional arrays

Simulated two-dimensional arrays (strings)

Loops (CMP, JE, JMP)

Conditional branching

Constants and variables

Irvine32 input/output procedures

▶️ How to Run the Project

Install Visual Studio

Set up MASM and Irvine32 library

Create a new MASM project and file name should have .asm extension.

Add the .asm file to the project

Build and run the project

⚠️ Make sure Irvine32 is correctly configured before running.


🚧 Limitations

Maximum of 10 novels can be stored

No file handling (data is lost after program exit)

No duplicate ID checking

Single-user system

🔮 Future Improvements

Add file handling for data persistence

Implement search by novel name or author

Increase storage capacity

Add genre and publication year
